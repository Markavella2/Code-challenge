// Name: DNA to RNA conversion

// Instructions:
// Deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA is the primary information storage molecule in biological systems. It is composed of four nucleic acid bases Guanine ('G'), Cytosine ('C'), Adenine ('A'), and Thymine ('T').

// Ribonucleic acid, RNA, is the primary messenger molecule in cells. RNA differs slightly from DNA its chemical structure and contains no Thymine. In RNA Thymine is replaced by another nucleic acid Uracil ('U').

// Create a function which translates a given DNA string into RNA.

// For example:

// "GCAT"  =>  "GCAU"
// The input string can be of arbitrary length - in particular, it may be empty. All input is guaranteed to be valid, i.e. each input string will only ever consist of 'G', 'C', 'A' and/or 'T'.

// Answer:
function DNAtoRNA(dna) {
    // create a function which returns an RNA sequence from the given DNA sequence
    return dna.replace(/[T]/g, "U")
  }



//   Name: Simple Comparison?

//   Instructions:
//   Write a function that will compare two values, one will be a number and one will be a string. Return true if they are the same character (regardless of their different data types) and return false if they are not.

// To make this challange harder and to promp the challenger to read up about coercion I have disabled some of the built in methods including .toString(), .join(), .split(), parseInt and .Number().

// Answer:
function add(a, b){
  if (a==b){
    return true
  }else{
    return false
  }
}
